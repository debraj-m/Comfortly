# Comfortly Frontend
We are building frontend a conversational AI platform that helps people with their mental health. Our frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and we use Next.js for server-side rendering.

## UI Considerations
- Use ShadCN components for UI elements.
- Ensure that the UI is accessible and user-friendly.
- Keep UI consistent with the overall design language of the application.
- Use responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on all devices.
- Keep the UI clean and minimalistic, focusing on the user experience.
